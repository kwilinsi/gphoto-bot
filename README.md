# gphoto-bot

gphoto-bot is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot that uses [gPhoto2](http://gphoto.org) to control a camera connected to the host machine. This allows the camera to be remotely controlled by multiple accounts through the Discord interface.

gphoto-bot is built using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) for interacting with Discord and the [python-gphoto2](https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/python-gphoto2) interface for [libgphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/).
